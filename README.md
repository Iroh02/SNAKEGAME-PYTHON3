# SNAKEGAME-PYTHON3
once the code is run, the game has begun;
the player has to use the arrow keys to move the "snake" around the board. As the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows larger. The game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself. The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens.
there is a scoreboard keeping track of the number of food particles the snake has eaten.
HAPPY GAMING!
